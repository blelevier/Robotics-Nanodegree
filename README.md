# Robotics Software Engineer - Udacity Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects for this program.

## Overview

The Robotics Sofware Engineer Nanodegree program will teach you:<br/>
• The software fundamentals to work on robotics using C++, ROS, and Gazebo.<br/>
• How to build autonomous robotics projects in a Gazebo simulation environment.<br/>
• Probabilistic robotics, including Localization, Mapping, SLAM, Navigation, and Path Planning.<br/>

More information on this Nanodegree [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209).


## Project 1: Build My World

Use Gazebo to simulate a robotic environment comprised of a building to house your future robot.<br/>
Skills: Gazebo, C++ plugins.

## Project 2: Go Chase It!
Use the Robot Operating System (ROS) to design a mobile robot. Then, house your newly-designed robot in the robotic environment you built in Project 1. You will program your robot with C++ to chase a ball through this world.<br/>
Skills: Catkin workspaces, ROS packages, ROS nodes, ROS launch files, RViz integration, and C++.

## Project 3: Where Am I?

Use the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm in ROS, in conjunction with sensor data and a map of the world, to estimate a mobile robot’s position and orientation so that your robot can answer the question “Where am I?”.<br/>
Skills: Localization algorithms(Kalman Filter and MCL), ROS parameters, ROS packages integration, C++.

## Project 4: Map My World Robot

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) can be implemented in a number of ways depending on the sensors used via various ROS packages. Use a ROS SLAM package and simulated sensor data to create an agent that can both map the world around it, and localize within it.<br/>
Skills: Mapping and SLAM algorithms, Occupancy Grid Mapping, Grid-based FastSLAM and GraphSLAM, ROS debugging tools, C++.

## Project 5: Home Service Robot

Combine everything you’ve learned in this program to simulate a home service robot that can map, localize, and navigate to transport objects, moving from one room to another autonomously.<br/>
Skills: Path Planning search algorithms, ROS navigation stack, C++.
